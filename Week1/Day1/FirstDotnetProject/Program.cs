Console.WriteLine("Hello and Welcome to the C# .Net Stack");

//Javascript 
// var varName = "hello"

// Python

// These languages tend to look a lot more verbose but it's for a reason!
// C#
string FirstVariable = "Welcome to C#";
// I needed the word string
// We have to declare data types at the start of EVERY variable
// Languages like JS and Python do not care for data type at the moment of creation - this means the memory used to store that data is arbitrary 
// In C# since we declare the data type from the beginning we take EXACTLY how much space we need for the variable
// Less memory used means smaller file sizes which means things load and download quicker

Console.WriteLine(FirstVariable);

// JS Js function
// function functionName(){}

//C# function 
// you need to specify what will be returning by the function

static void functionName()
{
    // void is the term we use when there is no Return Statement
}

static string Hello()
{
    return "Hello";
}
